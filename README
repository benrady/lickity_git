What Is....

Lickity_git is a Distributed Continuous Integration system for Git. It automatically builds and changes committed to your local repository and, if successful, pushes them to the remote repo.

INSTALLATION

Simply add the lickity_git directory to your system path, and call 'lickity' from the root of any git repository. Lickity_git will monitor that repo for changes, run builds, and push as necessary.
